        <p>Arabesque Kuala Lumpur is a cosy Middle Eastern restaurant that’s been gaining a steady following of locals and tourists in KL city centre since opening for business in September 2014.The food here is fantastic and the service is warm and friendly, as you would expect from a family run operation. This eatery is easily distinguished by its black and white archway, maroon-hued walls, and a kebab station by the entrance while its air-conditioned interior is a simple layout of black furnishings, tiled floors, with several framed Arabic-themed artwork on the otherwise bare walls.</p>
        <img src="images/restaurant/arabesque/1.jpg" id="main-thumbnail">
        <p>Its food menu is an expansive mix of traditional Turkish, Egyptian and Syrian delicacies while beverages range from fresh fruit juices such as the fresh lemon mint (RM10) to traditionally-prepared Turkish coffee with baklava (RM9) and Arabian tea (RM5). Arabesque Kuala Lumpur also serves unique sweets of the day for dessert, where you can enjoy nutty halva ice-cream (RM5), which is made with Middle Eastern sweet sesame paste and studded with cashews, pistachios, and almonds.
          <br>For starters, the shawerma platter (RM30) consists of grilled chicken shawerma cutlets served with sliced tomatoes, cucumber pickles, garlic sauce, and a side of French fries. The falafel roll (RM10) is another must-try, which comes in four deep-fried falafel rings, tomato, lettuce, fresh mint and diced lemon bits. Topped with tahini (ground, hulled sesame seeds) yoghurt sauce and wrapped with Arabic bread, this crispy fritter is a popular street food amongst vegetarians and vegans.</p>

        <p>Portions served at Arabesque Kuala Lumpur are rather substantial, making it a good choice for value-for-money group dining in downtown KL. Standout dishes include the mixed grill platter (RM40), where diners can enjoy generous amounts of shish taouk (chicken skewers), lamb shish and lamb kabab with Arabian bread and French fries for sides. If you’re in the mood for rice, try the grilled half chicken (RM25) marinated in lemon, garlic and herbs, with a healthy serving of saffron rice (RM9). Meat-free options include the fattoush (RM16), a mixed salad dish with plenty of chopped lettuce, cucumber, tomato and spring onions, garlic and toasted bread, topped with lemon juice, olive oil and a tinge of vinegar.
          <br>Situated near the end of the Petaling Street night market, Arabesque Kuala Lumpur is accessible within a five-minute walk from the Pasar Seni LRT train station. Service here is also prompt and friendly, while its subdued ambience is great for those who want a temporary escape from the often overcrowded Chinatown KL area.</p>
